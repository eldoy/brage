# Brage.js

Concept Javascript component library for single page web applications. Very minimal, only 150 lines of code, no dependencies, just plain vanilla Javascript (ES6). Does not use a virtual DOM, updates must be done by calling render manually.

Includes complete webpack setup and tests. Enjoy!

## USAGE

Clone the repo, and do ```npm install``` then ```npm run dev```. Start the tests with ```npm run test```.

Do ```npm install -g live-server``` and run ```live-server --entry-file=./index.html``` from the ```dist``` directory, then navigate to ```http://localhost:8080``` in your browser to view the example app. Hot code reloading supported.

```javascript
section(
  h1('Header'),
  p('This is how you use it'),
  ul({ class: 'list' },
    li('Steak'),
    li('Milk'),
    li('Eggs'),
    li('Liver')
  ),
  aside('Cool?')
)
```
