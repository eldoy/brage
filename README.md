# Brage.js

Concept Javascript component library for single page web applications. Very minimal, only 150 lines of code, no dependencies, just plain vanilla Javascript (ES6). Does not use a virtual DOM, updates must be done by calling render manually.

Includes complete webpack setup and tests. Enjoy!

## USAGE

Clone the repo, and do ```npm install``` then ```npm run dev```. The live server should start automatically in your browser at ```http://localhost:8080```. Hot code reloading included out of the box.

Start the tests with ```npm run test```.

```javascript
section(
  h1('Brage.js is so easy'),
  p('This is how you use it'),
  ul({ class: 'list' },
    li('Steak'),
    li('Milk'),
    li('Eggs'),
    li('Liver')
  ),
  aside('Cool?')
)
```
